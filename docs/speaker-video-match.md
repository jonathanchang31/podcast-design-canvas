# Speaker Video Match

Separately recorded speakers should look like they belong in the same conversation, even when they recorded in different rooms with different cameras.

## User Goal

A creator should be able to bring mismatched speaker recordings closer in look before choosing a preset, so the episode feels like one production.

## Match Targets

Offer plain-language corrections:

- brightness balance across speakers
- color warmth consistency
- exposure correction for backlit speakers
- background simplification for cluttered rooms
- contrast normalization between recordings

Each adjustment should preview on the real speaker frame and show a before-and-after comparison.

## Preview Contexts

Creators should judge video matching on episode moments where mismatches are easiest to notice:

- a solo close-up of the current speaker
- a split-screen exchange between host and guest
- a branded preset preview with captions visible
- a darker or backlit speaking moment
- a quick switch from one speaker to the next

Previewing more than one moment keeps creators from approving a correction that only works for the brightest frame or a single preset layout.

These previews should make the correction decision obvious:

- show a paused frame and a short playback loop for the same moment
- compare the corrected speaker against at least one other participant in the same layout
- keep the active preset framing visible so creators can judge whether matching still feels natural once the episode is styled
- preserve the same timestamp while switching between corrected and original footage

## Creator Controls

Use simple controls:

- auto-match all speakers to the best-lit recording
- adjust a single speaker manually
- reset to original look
- lock a speaker's correction before applying a preset
- skip matching when recordings already look consistent

Avoid exposing white balance kelvin values, histograms, LUTs, or color grading curves in this path.

## When To Match

Speaker video matching should happen after import and before preset selection:

- source quality issues surface in `docs/source-media-health.md`
- matched video feeds into the preset preview in `docs/preset-style-picker.md`
- corrections persist through canvas editing in `docs/canvas-layer-controls.md`

Matching should not undo the creator's preset or brand choices later in the flow.

## Review States

Use simple states:

- matched
- needs review
- skipped

These states should appear during ingest readiness only when the mismatch would be visible in the finished episode. When a creator leaves this step, the chosen state should carry into `docs/preset-style-picker.md` Apply And Preview so preset comparisons reflect the corrected footage instead of the untreated source.

## Template Reuse

When a show template includes recurring speakers, the product should remember their correction preferences from previous episodes and offer them as a starting point.

Those remembered corrections should stay tied to `docs/show-template-adaptation.md` Adaptation Flow so the creator can keep a helpful starting point for recurring speakers without silently forcing the same correction onto a changed recording setup.

If a recurring guest's look has changed, the creator should be able to reuse the prior preference, adjust it for this episode only, or skip it and keep the template preference for later episodes.

## Maintainer Acceptance Notes

Accept work that helps creators make separately recorded speakers feel visually coherent before preset selection and layout review. Close work that turns matching into technical color-grading tooling, silently forces corrections onto changed recordings, or hides the before-and-after effect from the creator.
